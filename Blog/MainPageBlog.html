            <h1>My Travels in Australia</h1>
            <p>When i go in Australia, I didn't have any stereotypes.</p>
            <p>I decided to going in Australia for visits and discover the culture.</p>
            <p>During my stay, I decide to make the turns of Australia. I visited Sydney, Perth, Canberra, Melbourne and another city.</p>
            <p>I discover the Australia day and what this history of this day hides. It's a really bad history for Australia. I didn't know why for him, he is celebrating this date whit happiness this day with happiness.</p>
            <p>My travels start to Sydney, It's the most populated city's in Australia. In this city's we can discover old European build. In a first time it's surprised me, because, you feel to be in an European country but the climate and the others architecture recalls you to where you are. </p>
            <p>I make a really fast break to explore Canberra and Melbourne. </p>
            <p>After that, I decide to going to Alice spring, And I'm totally subjugate by the fauna and flora. It's really gorgeous. See the pics in the tab "pics". </p>
            <p>After this step, I going to Perth, the capital city of Western Australia. It's an old British colony founded in 1829 by the captain James Stirling. Right now, this city is impressive and we can discover, again, an old European building. </p>
            <p>I continue to Darwin, I'm a little bit disappointed, for me it's just a city for have a great week in holidays to the beach and I didn't find anything who can be interesting me. </p>
            <p>And for finish, I going to see the great barrier reef. It's the most beautiful reef than I have seen. </p>
            <p>In conclusion, for me, Australia is a great country to explore, for the beauty of the landscape and their history. </p>
